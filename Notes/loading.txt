INIT
Random player - This will load a player with a random background/race/gender/ect.

Choose a random number for the nations in the game, between 3 and 7. This will also dictate how much 'free' space there is in the galaxy. 

Spawn the races that will make up these nations. Have a pool of around 20(?) that can be pulled from.

Spawn the names for each of the leaders based on their race. 

Use a name list to spawn names for each section of space.


MAP
Set the home planets and an area around them to spawn different map units.
