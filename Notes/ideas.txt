*** IDEAS ***
Just random ideas that pop into my head.


- Space Samurai
Instead of projectile weapons allow samurai swords as well. ENERGY SWORDS!!!

- Starting as a Slave?
You can start with a really good ship if you start as a slave. You will be enslaved until you can find a gadget to unlock your ship. You will have a bounty on your head aftwards though, but not a big one.

- Background Idea: Lab Experiment
The player is a lab experiment so they get crazy stats but a hefty bounty on their heads starting out with a basic research ship.

- Bounties
You can pay off your own bounty + a percentage to a shadow agency and they will claim it by taking osome of your DNA and creating a corpse of yourself.

- Shipmates
Your party will move/act on it's own? When you land somewhere, if it's a 'civilized' area, they will leave the ship and you will have to put out a call to have them come back within a set amount of hours.

- Previous Game Ideas
Roll all the previous game ideas.  

- Research Ships
Ships/Stations that are there for research. The play may be tasked with stealing something from them. These can be both national official research facilities or black market ones. 

- JOBS
Starting jobs like trash man. The player can do that or farm on a planet. The starting career will dictate what the player starts with. For example a trash man starts with a trash ship and a job already lined up.

- Cults/Religion
There are set established religions and also cults and movements that may pop up during the play through.

- Ship/House
The player can land anywhere on a planet and use the ship as a house. Farm or mine?

- Family
The player has a family, the structure based on their species, that they can write to and visit? Events could happen that end up killing the parents.

- Homes
The player can rent small apartments from a space station for really cheap. 100 credits quarterly. They can buy one for 50,000 credits.

- Holidays
Randomly generated holidays for each species? At least four for each...

- Mafia
There are mafia families in the game...if they're selected to spawn.
