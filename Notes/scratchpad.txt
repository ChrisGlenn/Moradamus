List my ideas here...

Starting off: No job, just starting stats and either a recommendation or a backstory that will facilitate where they can 'go' from there.

Entertainment:
The player can play various side games:
Video Games
Sports (pong, ect)

Books:
There are no actual book just a summary that will give the player the overview of the book and will update anything
