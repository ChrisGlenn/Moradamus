List my ideas here...

Starting off: No job, just starting stats and either a recommendation or a backstory that will facilitate where they can 'go' from there.

Entertainment:
The player can play various side games:
Video Games
Instruments
Sports

Books:
There are no actual book just a summary that will give the player the overview of the book and will update anything.


- Corporations
Gemini Terminal System (GTS) is the main OS of the game. The 'Windows' or 'Apple' of the galaxy. There is an alternative OS called Open Terminal System (OTS) that is the 'linux' of the galaxy. OTS is used by underground networks, outsiders, ect. There are people who are devotees of each system. GTS is produced by Gemini Systems who's enigmatic CEO is a celebrity in the galaxy.

- Space Samurai
Instead of projectile weapons allow samurai swords as well. ENERGY SWORDS!!!

- Starting as a Slave?
You can start with a really good ship if you start as a slave. You will be enslaved until you can find a gadget to unlock your ship. You will have a bounty on your head aftwards though, but not a big one.

- Background Idea: Lab Experiment
The player is a lab experiment so they get crazy stats but a hefty bounty on their heads starting out with a basic research ship.

- Bounties
You can pay off your own bounty + a percentage to a shadow agency and they will claim it by taking osome of your DNA and creating a corpse of yourself.

- Shipmates
Your party will move/act on it's own? When you land somewhere, if it's a 'civilized' area, they will leave the ship and you will have to put out a call to have them come back within a set amount of hours.

- Previous Game Ideas
Roll all the previous game ideas.  

- Research Ships
Ships/Stations that are there for research. The play may be tasked with stealing something from them. These can be both national official research facilities or black market ones. 

- JOBS
Starting jobs like trash man. The player can do that or farm on a planet. The starting career will dictate what the player starts with. For example a trash man starts with a trash ship and a job already lined up.

- Cults/Religion
There are set established religions and also cults and movements that may pop up during the play through.

- Ship/House
The player can land anywhere on a planet and use the ship as a house. Farm or mine?

- Family
The player has a family, the structure based on their species, that they can write to and visit? Events could happen that end up killing the parents.

- Homes
The player can rent small apartments from a space station for really cheap. 100 credits quarterly. They can buy one for 50,000 credits.

- Holidays
Randomly generated holidays for each species? At least four for each...

- Mafia
There are mafia families in the game...if they're selected to spawn.

- Portmaster
Your ship can be docked and locked if you enter a hostile system or commit a 'crime'. Which leads too...
- Unauthorized Ports
Places you can land if you're unable to legally land in a port (there are risks with this...)
